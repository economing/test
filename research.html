				<b>A Hard Nut to Crack: Identifying Factors Relevant to Chestnut Consumption</b></a>
				(written with Erin Lizotte and Trey Malone, <i> Journal of Food Distribution Research</i> 50.2, 2019).
			</div>
			<div class="rscontent p-b">
				Chestnuts are popular worldwide, but they are not commonly purchased in the United States. Using
				a survey of over 1,000 U.S. and over 1,000 Chinese consumers, we use geospatial techniques and
				explore why over half of U.S. consumers have never eaten a chestnut. We test questions regarding
				key geographic, social, and cultural characteristics of likely U.S. chestnut consumers. Results
				suggest that immigration patterns weakly affect chestnut consumption but that age is a more
				important predictor of consumption frequency. Our empirical analysis suggests that consumers in
				coastal states consume the most chestnuts and that socioeconomic characteristics significantly
				influence consumption.

				<b>Relative Income and Subjective Economic Status: Empirical Evidence from the Perspective of the Collectivism Culture</b></a>
				(written in Chinese with Tao Li, Lin Fu and Xingye Jin, <i> Economic Research Journal </i> 12, 2019).
			</div>
			<div class="rscontent p-b">
				Subjective economic status, the subjective perception of one's economic status in society, depends on not only
				the objective economic status but also the way people perceive their relative standing and therefore corresponds
				to the cultural context. We study the impact of the objective relative income on subjective economic status using
				data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) and the regression results indicates that people's subjective economic
				status is significantly affected by the objective relative income. Furthermore, results from both our OLS and IV estimates
				shows that the objective relative income has stronger impact on subjective economic status in area with stronger collectivist
				culture. Our paper sheds light on the important role of the institutional factor-culture plays on subjective welfare.

				<b>Social Network and Consumption Smoothing in Rural India</b>
				(written with Songqing Jin, <i>  </i> update: May 14, 2021).
			</div>
			<div class="rscontent p-b">
				Consumption smoothing, which measures the extent to which one can buffer
				shocks, is an important ability for rural farmers in developing countries where the
				formal credits or financial market are missing. A large body of literature has
				documented the crucial impact of social networks on consumption smoothing. Using a
				large-scale survey data from India, we investigate the consumption smoothing behavior
				in the context of rural India with a focus on caste-based social networks. Our result first
				indicates that while households’ consumption is partially insured, the full insurance or
				efficient risk-sharing within the village is rejected. Moreover, we instrument the
				idiosyncratic income change with rainfall deviation and find a smoother consumption
				within the backward caste groups. We also find that the consumption of households
				with intra-caste or intra-caste group interactions only is relatively smoother than
				households who also have interactions across castes or caste groups, which could be
				explained by the possible stronger intra-caste social interactions of the former group,
				and this provides indirect evidence of risk-sharing within the caste. Besides, our result
				suggests that households with experience of migration working do better in
				consumption smoothing. While this might be more likely a result of the extra buffer
				mechanism against idiosyncratic shock in agriculture, the potential stronger out-village
				social network could also contribute to it.

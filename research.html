					<b>A Hard Nut to Crack: Identifying Factors Relevant to Chestnut Consumption</b></a>

					Chestnuts are popular worldwide, but they are not commonly purchased in the United States. Using
					a survey of over 1,000 U.S. and over 1,000 Chinese consumers, we use geospatial techniques and
					explore why over half of U.S. consumers have never eaten a chestnut. We test questions regarding
					key geographic, social, and cultural characteristics of likely U.S. chestnut consumers. Results
					suggest that immigration patterns weakly affect chestnut consumption but that age is a more
					important predictor of consumption frequency. Our empirical analysis suggests that consumers in
					coastal states consume the most chestnuts and that socioeconomic characteristics significantly
					influence consumption.

					<b>Relative Income and Subjective Economic Status: Empirical Evidence from the Perspective of the Collectivism Culture</b></a>
					(written in Chinese with Tao Li, Lin Fu and Xingye Jin, <i> Economic Research Journal </i> 12, 2019).
				</div>
				<div class="rscontent p-b">
					Subjective economic status, the subjective perception of one's economic status in society, depends on not only
					the objective economic status but also the way people perceive their relative standing and therefore corresponds
					to the cultural context. We study the impact of the objective relative income on subjective economic status using
					data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) and the regression results indicates that people's subjective economic
					status is significantly affected by the objective relative income. Furthermore, results from both our OLS and IV estimates
					shows that the objective relative income has stronger impact on subjective economic status in area with stronger collectivist
					culture. Our paper sheds light on the important role of the institutional factor-culture plays on subjective welfare.

					<b>Social Network and Consumption Smoothing in Rural India</b>
					(written with Songqing Jin, <i>  </i> update: May 14, 2021).
				</div>
				<div class="rscontent p-b">
					Consumption smoothing, which measures the extent to which one can buffer
					shocks, is an important ability for rural farmers in developing countries where the
					formal credits or financial market are missing. A large body of literature has
					documented the crucial impact of social networks on consumption smoothing. Using a
					large-scale survey data from India, we investigate the consumption smoothing behavior
					in the context of rural India with a focus on caste-based social networks. Our result first
					indicates that while households’ consumption is partially insured, the full insurance or
					efficient risk-sharing within the village is rejected. Moreover, we instrument the
					idiosyncratic income change with rainfall deviation and find a smoother consumption
					within the backward caste groups. We also find that the consumption of households
					with intra-caste or intra-caste group interactions only is relatively smoother than
					households who also have interactions across castes or caste groups, which could be
					explained by the possible stronger intra-caste social interactions of the former group,
					and this provides indirect evidence of risk-sharing within the caste. Besides, our result
					suggests that households with experience of migration working do better in
					consumption smoothing. While this might be more likely a result of the extra buffer
					mechanism against idiosyncratic shock in agriculture, the potential stronger out-village
					social network could also contribute to it.
